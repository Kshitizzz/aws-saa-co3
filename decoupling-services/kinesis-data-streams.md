# Amazon Kinesis - Deep Dive: Data Streams vs Data Firehose

---

## 🧠 Memory Hook

- "Kinesis = Real-time data river."
- "Streams = You manage it. Firehose = AWS handles it."
- "Data Streams = Processing. Firehose = Delivery."

---

## 📦 What is Amazon Kinesis?

A **real-time data streaming platform** designed to:
- **Ingest**, **process**, and **deliver** massive volumes of data.
- Use cases: clickstreams, app logs, IoT sensor data, financial transactions, etc.

## 🔀 Kinesis Data Streams (KDS)

### ✅ Core Concepts

- **Shards**: Unit of capacity (1MB/sec in, 2MB/sec out, 1000 records/sec).
- **Producers**: Send data into stream (apps, agents, IoT devices).
- **Consumers**:
  - **KCL app (EC2/Lambda)**: custom processors
  - **Lambda**: event-based trigger
  - **Kinesis Data Analytics**: SQL processing
- **Retention**: Default 24 hrs (extendable to 7 days, or 365 w/ extended retention).
- **Ordering**: Maintained within each shard.

### 📘 Real-World Use Cases

- Clickstream analytics
- IoT telemetry
- Real-time fraud detection
- Server logs / telemetry processing
- Machine learning pipeline ingestion

### ⚙️ Nuances

- You must **manually manage scaling** (add/remove shards).
- **Checkpointing** is your responsibility unless using Lambda.
- Use **partition keys** to route data consistently to shards.

---

## 🚚 Kinesis Data Firehose

### ✅ Core Concepts

- Fully managed **delivery stream**: automatically scales and batches data.
- **No shards or partition keys** to manage.
- Supports **transformations** using Lambda.
- **Automatic retry + buffering**.
- **Targets**:
  - Amazon S3
  - Amazon Redshift
  - Amazon OpenSearch
  - 3rd party HTTPS endpoints

### 📘 Real-World Use Cases

- Real-time log ingestion → S3 → Athena/Glue
- CloudWatch log export to Redshift
- App telemetry pipelines → Elasticsearch

### ⚙️ Nuances

- **Near-real-time**, not true real-time (60 sec buffering or 1MB by default).
- **No ordering guarantee**.
- **Limited transformations** (Lambda-only).
- Supports **data compression + encryption**.

## 🔁 Data Streams vs Firehose

| Feature                | Data Streams (KDS)                          | Firehose                                |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Management             | Self-managed shards                         | Fully managed                            |
| Use Case               | Real-time processing                        | Easy delivery to storage/analytics       |
| Latency                | Millisecond                                 | Seconds (buffered)                       |
| Ordering               | Yes (per shard)                             | No guarantee                             |
| Data Transformation    | Consumers handle                            | Built-in with Lambda                     |
| Delivery               | To custom processors                        | S3, Redshift, OpenSearch, HTTPS          |
| Retry Logic            | You handle (or Lambda retry)                | Automatic retries                        |
| Scaling                | Manual (add/remove shards)                  | Automatic                                |
| Cost                   | Pay-per-shard                               | Pay-per-GB delivered                     |

## 🔐 Security Features

- Supports **KMS encryption at rest**.
- **VPC endpoints** (PrivateLink) supported.
- IAM policies control access to delivery streams and record submission.

## 📊 Real Architecture Example

### Scenario: Real-Time Log Ingestion + Query

App Logs → Firehose (buffered) → S3 (Partitioned)
↓
(Lambda transform: JSON format)
Then:
→ Glue Data Catalog
→ Athena for querying logs

**Benefits**:

- Auto-scale ingestion
- Easy querying without a DB
- Durable, reliable, cheap storage

---

## ✅ Exam Pointers

- Kinesis **Data Streams** is for **real-time** apps → ML, fraud, IoT.
- Kinesis **Firehose** is for **delivery** to S3, Redshift, OpenSearch.
- Use **Firehose** when:
  - You want **no management overhead**.
  - You're buffering logs into S3.
- Use **Data Streams** when:
  - You need **real-time analytics** or processing.
  - You need **ordering guarantees**.
- Firehose does **not support reprocessing**. Use Streams + Lambda or analytics.

---

## ⚠️ Gotchas & Tips

- Don’t confuse Kinesis **Data Analytics** (SQL on streams) with the ingestion services.
- Firehose uses **internal buffering** — may increase latency.
- No **dead letter queues** (DLQ) in Firehose. You need to catch failed Lambda transforms manually.
- Use **Kinesis Agent** or **CloudWatch Logs subscription** to push logs to Firehose.
