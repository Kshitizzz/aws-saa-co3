## datasync vs storage gateway

- use aws datasync when heavy and securer migration is needed to cloud storage (s3) from on-premise
- like a complete migration where on-premise storage will ceased to be used
- use storage gateway when you wanna have a:
- hybrid setup
- want to free up on-premise storage and by migrating data to the cloud
- to continue using on-prem storage and migration to cloud storage as on-prem gets filled
