# Auto Scaling Group - Types of Scaling Policies

---

## üß† Memory Hook
- "Scale on metrics (CPU), schedules (cron), or magic (target-tracking)."
- ‚ÄúASG = Dynamic engine room. Scaling policies = the autopilot settings.‚Äù

---

## ‚úÖ Must-Know Scaling Policy Types

### 1. **Target Tracking Scaling (Most Common ‚úÖ)**
- **"Set it and forget it" policy**
- You define a **target metric** (e.g. keep average CPU utilization at 60%)
- ASG automatically adjusts capacity to maintain that target
- Works like a thermostat

**Example:**
- Target metric: CPU Utilization = 50%
- ASG will launch or terminate instances as needed to hover around 50%


**‚úÖ Best for:** Simple, predictable scaling goals  
**‚ö†Ô∏è Can't define cooldowns manually ‚Äî it's handled by AWS internally**

---

### 2. **Step Scaling**
- Define **explicit metric thresholds** and **scaling actions**
- Supports **scale in/out steps** based on metric breach severity
- You control:
  - **Thresholds**
  - **Adjustment types (add/remove count or percentage)**
  - **Cooldown periods**

**Example:**
If CPU > 70% for 5 minutes ‚Üí Add 2 instances
If CPU > 85% for 5 minutes ‚Üí Add 4 instances
If CPU < 40% ‚Üí Remove 1 instance


**‚úÖ Best for:** Fine-grained control over scaling  
**‚ö†Ô∏è Requires manual configuration + CloudWatch alarms**

---

### 3. **Simple Scaling (Legacy)**
- Trigger **a single action** when a CloudWatch alarm goes off
- Waits for cooldown before evaluating the next alarm

**Example:**
If CPU > 70% for 5 min ‚Üí Add 1 instance (wait 300s cooldown)

**‚úÖ Best for:** Very simple setups (not recommended anymore)  
**‚ö†Ô∏è Can lead to slower scaling due to cooldown delays**

---

### 4. **Scheduled Scaling**
- Pre-defined **time-based rules** (like cron jobs)
- Use when you can predict demand (e.g. business hours traffic)

**Example:**
Every weekday at 9AM ‚Üí Set min=4, desired=6
Every night at 9PM ‚Üí Set min=2, desired=2


**‚úÖ Best for:** Predictable traffic patterns (e.g., batch workloads, 9‚Äì5 office apps)

---

## üìò Exam Pointers

- **Target Tracking** is most recommended ‚Äî exam often highlights it
- **Step Scaling** = More control, but more complex to configure
- **Simple Scaling** = Legacy, avoid unless explicitly asked
- **Scheduled Scaling** = Works best with known workload cycles
- ASGs **scale only EC2 instances**, not containers or Lambda

## üîß Real-World Usage Patterns

| Use Case                              | Recommended Policy         |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| API service with variable traffic     | Target Tracking            |
| Batch jobs at night                   | Scheduled Scaling          |
| Heavy traffic spikes                  | Step Scaling (reactive)    |
| Dev/Test environment cleanup          | Scheduled Scaling          |
| Predictable cyclical workloads        | Scheduled or Target Tracking |

## üß© General Explanation

Scaling policies in ASG allow EC2 fleets to **grow and shrink automatically** based on:
- **Metrics** (CPU, network, custom CloudWatch metrics)
- **Time schedules**
- **Alarm thresholds**

- Choosing the right policy helps maintain **performance + cost efficiency**.-
