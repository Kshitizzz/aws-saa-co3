# EventBridge Schema Registry

## Memory Hook

- “Schemas = Blueprint of Events”
- “Decode the event. Understand the payload.”

---

## ✅ Must-Know Core Concepts

- **EventBridge Schema** = Event JSON structure metadata (field names, data types).
- Schema = like a **contract** describing how an event looks.
- Used when you don’t know:
  - What fields the event will contain
  - What values are expected
- Can be used to:
  - **Validate events**
  - **Auto-generate code bindings** (Java, Python, TypeScript, etc.)

## 🎯 Key Components

| Component         | Description                                           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Schema Registry** | Stores all schemas (AWS, Custom, Discovered)          |
| **Schemas**       | JSON definition of event fields & types              |
| **Discoverer**    | Captures schema by watching events on a bus          |
| **Code Bindings** | Auto-generates class models for events in SDK        |

---

## 🧪 Types of Schemas

1. **AWS Schemas**: For AWS service events (e.g., EC2, S3, Lambda)
2. **Discovered Schemas**: Generated by the Discoverer based on observed events
3. **Custom Schemas**: You define them for your app’s events

---

## ⚠️ Nuances & Edge Cases

- Schemas are **region-specific** — must be created per region.
- Discoverer only works when **attached to a specific Event Bus**.
- Schema discovery must be **manually enabled**, not automatic.
- Code bindings are optional but **great for strongly typed Lambda code**.
- **No cost for using schemas**, but schema discovery may incur cost after a certain limit.

## 📌 Exam Pointers

- “Don’t know what fields are in event?” → ✅ Use Schema Discovery
- “Need to generate code for event payloads?” → ✅ Use Schema Registry + Code Bindings
- “Validate custom app events before routing?” → ✅ Use Custom Schema
- “Want to log structure of unknown event types?” → ✅ Enable Schema Discovery on custom bus

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- Auto-generate TypeScript class for Zendesk webhook event
- Log EC2 state-change structure to design automation
- Help developers build apps that react to partner events confidently
