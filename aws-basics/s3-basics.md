	4. DEFAULT STORAGE SERVICE IN AWS

			i. Bucket name should be GLOBALLY UNIQUE, not regional, account unique -- IMP
			ii. Can hold unlimited number of objects -- infinite scalable storage system -- unlimited storage
			iii. FLAT storage -- no file structure -- conceptual folders can be created by using / in object name
			iv. Eg -- study_material/videos/video-1.mp4
