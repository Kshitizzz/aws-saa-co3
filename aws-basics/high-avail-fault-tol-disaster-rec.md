  ## high availability (HA)
	
	1. HA is maximising a system's  ONLINE TIME
	2. HA aims to ENSURE an agreed level of operational PERFORMANCE, usually UPTIME, for a HIGHER THAN NORMAL PERIOD.
	3. Example -- HA for a server based infrastructure would be to have a standby server ready to be used in case the main server goes down.
	4. HA is about keeping the system operational by minimising or automating the issues that come up.
	5. HA IS NOT ABOUT PREVENTING USER DISRUPTION
	6. DISRUPTION - When you have a flat tyre, the time spent in replacing that tire with a spare tyre (HA) is called DISRUPTION.
	7.  HA might need redundant infrastructure
	
  ## fault tolerance (FT)
	8. FT is a property that allows a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.
	9. Should operate while the faults are being fixed
	10. HA	FT	DR
	  - Maximising Uptime	Operating through failure	Recovery from failure to continue services
	  - Minimising Outages	Operate thru faults -- much more expensive	When HA and FT donâ€™t Work, DR is used
