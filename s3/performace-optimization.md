# S3 Performance Optimization Features

## Memory Hook  
- “Big files? Break and conquer. Multi Part Upload”  
- “Far away users? Transfer Accelerate.”  
- “Want parallelism? Use Byte range.”

---

## ✅ Multipart Uploads

### What It Is  
- Allows you to **upload large objects in parts (chunks)** concurrently.
- Supported for objects **larger than 5 MB**, **recommended for >100 MB**.
- Each part can be up to **5 GB**, total object size can be **up to 5 TB**.

### Benefits  
- ✅ Faster uploads via parallel threads  
- ✅ Resume interrupted uploads (re-upload failed part only)  
- ✅ Useful for unstable networks or large backups

### How It Works  
1. Initiate multipart upload  
2. Upload each part (can be in parallel)  
3. Complete upload to combine parts into one object  

### Exam Tip  
- Multipart uploads are **not visible as objects** until the upload is completed  
- You can **abort incomplete multipart uploads** via **Lifecycle rules**

## ✅ S3 Transfer Acceleration

### What It Is  
- Uses the **AWS global edge network** (CloudFront infrastructure) to **accelerate S3 uploads/downloads** over long distances 
- Works via a **dedicated CloudFront-style endpoint**: https://<bucket>.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com

### Use Case  
- Users in **geographically distant regions**  
- Mobile apps with slow or high-latency networks  
- Centralized uploads from global clients  

### Pricing  
- 💰 More expensive than standard S3  
- Charged **per GB transferred** using the acceleration endpoint

### Exam Tip  
- Must be **explicitly enabled per bucket**  
- **Does not accelerate cross-region replication**

## ✅ Byte-Range Fetches / Download

### What It Is  
- Allows applications to **download only a portion of an object** by specifying byte ranges in the GET request.
- Example:  
- Range: bytes=0–1048575
- its like multi-part **DOWNLOAD**, the parts are specified by Byte Ranges


### Use Case 
- get the metadata of the objects
- get the header of CSV files
- get the test dataset from train-test dataset 
- Resume **partial downloads**  
- Enable **parallelized download** of large files (e.g., video streaming, ML datasets)  
- Avoid pulling entire object into memory  

### Exam Tip  
- Often used with **multi-threaded clients**  
- see multi-threaded apps, think S3 byte range fetches / download
- Combine with **multipart upload** for both directions of performance
- full duplex data transfer using S3 multipart upload + S3 byte range download
